A typical Robot Framework project has the following file structure:


Library Folder - contains custom keyword libraries.
Resources Folder – contains the reusable Robot code files.
Results Folder – contains the executed test results. (log.html, output.xml and report.html)
Tests Folder – contains the Robot tests.
Variable Folder - Contain Variables file and Yamal file (Stored instance data, URLs, username, passwords, ect)

TEST SCRIPTS
Robot Framework test scripts are text files with the *.robot or *.txt extensions. The four sections of basic Robot test scripts are setting, variables, keywords, and test cases.

SETTINGS
The settings section contains the import statements for the external libraries, resources, and the setup and teardown commands. (Eg. Library     SeleniumLibrary)



VARIABLES
The variables section contains keyword arguments, global, and local values. Variables make it easy to change the test data in one location.

KEYWORDS
The keywords section contains operations used to execute the tests. The different types of keywords are built-in keywords, library keywords, and user-defined keywords. Built-in and library keywords are lower-level keywords defined by the built-in Robot Framework library or an external library such as Selenium. User-defined keywords are keywords created by combining library keywords.

TEST CASES
The test cases section contains the test cases.


TAGS
Tags are a way of classifying test cases. Tags in the test case section are in brackets. Commonly used tags are:

[Arguments] - Specify numeric or string arguments {my_argument}
Documentation - A description of the test
[Tags] - Type of test – Smoke
